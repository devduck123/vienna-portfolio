      "Later in 2022, Meta organized another series of events to welcome all Metamates the office across the Bay Area. With a considerable budget, we were able to host these events in our favorite vendors for decoration, entertainment, and catering. My favorite activities included live music, local food and coffee vendors, art workshops, pumpkin decorating, movie nights, swag giveaways, photo booths, toy drives and care packages to give back to the community, and more. Iâ€™m so proud to have lead and executed all graphic communications and design for this project. I had a blast designing marketing materials, event signage, stickers, and Facebook posts to promote these events. Each of these events hosted up to 1,500 attendees guaranteed to have a fun time!",

Event was so successful, our team was asked to host a second session later that year!",
